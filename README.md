# Java-HeapSortTimer
This is a basic timer to calculate the average time complexity of Heap Sort, by determining the time of sorting n objects and then the time of 2n objects.

This project uses code from http://www.code2learn.com/2011/09/heapsort-array-based-implementation-in.html?m=1 for the actual sorting implementation. 
And code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10465989/calculate-average-or-take-in-an-arraylist-as-a-parameter-to-a-function for calculating the average from an ArrayList.
The code for the main method is my own.
